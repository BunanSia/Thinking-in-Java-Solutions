In Blips.java, copy the file and rename it to BlipCheck.java and rename the class
Blip2 to BlipCheck (making it public and removing the public scope from the class
Blips in the process). Remove the //! marks in the file and execute the program,
including the offending lines. Next, comment out the default constructor for BlipCheck.
Run it and explain why it works. Note that after compiling, you must execute
the program with "java Blips" because the main() method is still in the class Blips.
